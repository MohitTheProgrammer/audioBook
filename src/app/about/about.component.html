            Hi there, Iâ€™m glad you found me. My name is <span class="red"> Arlo Brown</span> and I like to make
            music.

            On this page you can find out what I have been up to lately and maybe even a little bit about where
            I will
            go in the future. For me, the greatest thing about being a musician is being in the position to
            inspire
            other people. I take such pleasure in hearing that people have been motivated to create after
            hearing my
            music, whether it be a painting, a poem, their own music or something completely different. Music is
            not a
            one way street, it is a conversation where the listener's role is as important as the artist's.
            Well, here
            you can find my side of it all.
